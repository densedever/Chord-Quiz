# Chord Quiz app
## Trains your ear to identify different chord colors

I found no good free application like this anywhere that didn't make you sign up for it, so I'm making one myself. This app is meant to train your ear to hear different chords, aimed at the beginner music student.

This is not even in pre-alpha yet, as the full structure isn't implemented. This is the barest of bare bones.

_Features/Wants:_
- triad quiz, major/minor/dim
- 4-note chords, 5-note, 6+note
- score system for quiz
- code for checking answers (multiple choice)
- record of win/loss? statistics over time?

_Requires:_
- Python 3.11.4
- PyGame 2.5.1
